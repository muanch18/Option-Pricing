\section{Partial Differential Equations}
A \textbf{Partial Differential Equation} relates two or more independent variables, a function to be solved for, and the partial derivatives of the function with respect to those variables. 
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}  $$

\section{Stochastic Differential Equations}
A \textbf{Stochastic Differential Equation} is a differential equation that involves a \textit{stochastic process}. It serves as a prominent figure in mathematical models with many applications in the telecommunications, chemistry, biology, and finance subject fields. 

\subsection{Stochastic Process}
A process defined as a group of random variables defined on a common probability space. These processes are used to model fluctuating systems, such as the exponential growth of a bacteria population, fluctuation in current, etc. The most standard/popular stochastic process is  \textit{Brownian Motion} also caused a \textit{Wiener Process}, which models the random motion of particles that are suspended in a specific medium, while also modeling the fluctuations in an asset's price. 
% should the math behind the brownian process be included?
